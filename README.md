**Parallel Sorting Algorithms using OpenMP and MPI**

In this project, we implemented and optimized multiple sorting algorithms using parallel computing paradigms to significantly improve performance on large datasets. The goal was to compare and evaluate the efficiency of parallel vs. serial implementations using OpenMP (shared memory parallelism) and MPI (distributed memory parallelism).

We implemented the following sorting algorithms:

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

Bucket Sort

Radix Sort

Each algorithm was developed in three versions:

Serial: Baseline implementation without parallelism

OpenMP-based: Leveraged multithreading on shared-memory systems

MPI-based: Used message-passing for distributed systems

Key outcomes:

Demonstrated substantial speedups with parallel implementations, especially for larger inputs

Gained hands-on experience with thread-level and process-level parallelism

Analyzed scalability and performance trade-offs across different architectures

This project provided practical exposure to high-performance computing and deepened our understanding of parallel algorithm design, synchronization, and data distribution strategies.
